"Little Johnny likes to gamble.

One day, his dad gets a new job, so his family has to move to a new city.

Johnny's dad thinks, ""I'll get a head start on Johnny's gambling.""

He calls the teacher and says, ""My son Johnny will be starting your class tomorrow, but he likes to gamble, so you'll have to keep an eye on him.""

The teacher says, ""Okay,"" because she can handle it.

The next day, Johnny walks into class and hands the teacher an apple and says, ""Hi, my name is Johnny.""

She says, ""Yes, I know who you are.""

Johnny smiles and says, ""I bet you $10 you've got a mole on your butt.""

The teacher thinks that she will break his little gambling problem, so she takes him up on the bet.

She pulls her pants down, shows him her butt, and there is no mole.

That afternoon, Johnny goes home and tells his dad that he lost $10 to the teacher and explains why.

His dad calls the teacher and says, ""Johnny said that he bet you that you had a mole on your butt and he lost.""

The teacher says, ""Yeah, and I think I broke his gambling problem.""

Johnny's dad laughs and says, ""No you didn't, he bet me $100 this morning that he'd see your ass before the day was over."""

The teacher thinks that she will break his little gambling problem, so she takes him up on the bet.

She pulls her pants down, shows him her butt, and there is no mole.

That afternoon, Johnny goes home and tells his dad that he lost $10 to the teacher and explains why.

His dad calls the teacher and says, ""Johnny said that he bet you that you had a mole on your butt and he lost.""

The teacher says, ""Yeah, and I think I broke his gambling problem.""

Johnny's dad laughs and says, ""No you didn't, he bet me $100 this morning that he'd see your ass before the day was over."""
"Little Johnny likes to gamble.

One day, his dad gets a new job, so his family has to move to a new city.

Johnny's dad thinks, ""I'll get a head start on Johnny's gambling.""

He calls the teacher and says, ""My son Johnny will be starting your class tomorrow, but he likes to gamble, so you'll have to keep an eye on him.""

The teacher says, ""Okay,"" because she can handle it.

The next day, Johnny walks into class and hands the teacher an apple and says, ""Hi, my name is Johnny.""

She says, ""Yes, I know who you are.""
